note over browser:
Solid lines: represent web form requests.

form requests and server reactions.
end note

browser->server: HTTP POST https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/exampleapp/new_note_spa

browser-->server: content-type: JSON-data

browser-->server:  JSON-data string {content: ...}

note over browser:
The event handler is executed by the spa.js 
file which renders the notes to the page 
via a push file: notes.push(note) and stops
a new GET request from happening with the 
method e.preventDefault()
end note 

note over server: 
No additional requests are made back to 
the browser but the new note is submitted
in the form due to the status code 201 creating
a new resource without redirecting the page.
end note 

server-->browser: status code: 201 created, no redirect

server-->browser: {"message":"note created"}

note over browser:
Page instantly loads the new content.
end note
