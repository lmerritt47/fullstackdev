end note

browser->server: HTTP POST https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/exampleapp/new_note_spa

browser-->server: content-type: JSON-data

browser-->server:  JSON-data string {content: ...}

note over browser:
event handler is executed by the spa.js 
file which renders the notes to the page 
via a push file: notes.push(note) and stops
a new GET request from happening with the 
method e.preventDefault()
end note 

note over server: 
no additional requests are sent back 
besides the new note submitted in the form 
due to the event handler js actions that limit
the default handling of form submit
end note 

server-->browser: status code: 201 created, no redirect

server-->browser: {"message":"note created"}

note over browser:

content from the JSON/application
